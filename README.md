# Find a Brewery

**Find a Brewery** is front-end, single-page application powered by [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) that I built as my Phase 1 project for Flatiron School. You can pull up a list of breweries, in alphabetical order, based on one of several search criteria, or you can simply pull up a list of the breweries closest to you (requires location permissions for your browser).
